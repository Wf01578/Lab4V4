# Lab4V4
Network Traffic Monitor

Allows a user to select a network Device (such as a wifi Card, or Motherboard Integrated Ethernet) and see all incoming/outgoing traffic on that device. 
Data is display in hexadecimal.

Allows a user to Save a snapshop of all traffic parsed since the program was started. Toolbar -> File -> Save
Allows a user to Open a previously saved record of traffic. Toolbar -> File -> Open

Allows a user to create a custom packet to be sent over the internet. Toolbar -> Send

Each packet parsed will be identifiable by its packet number, and each packet is seperated for easier viewing & monitoring.
This program is fairly limited in functionality and served to teach me more about networking/packets.

To use this program: Download the repository (only top-level files are required, SRC Folder contains source code for those interested), unzip it into any folder
and run the Lab4V4.exe. Select your desired network device, and press start.
